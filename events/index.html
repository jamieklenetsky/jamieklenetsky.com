But he turned his back on poetry completely just a few years later. He traveled the world, and then lived in Ethiopia for several years before his early death at 37. During his time in remote obscurity, his reputation grew to the point that there were calls for a statue to be erected in his honor. But despite many rumors of his whereabouts, the first confirmed sighting was at his funeral in his hometown on the Belgian border.</p><p>C4 presents an original semi-staged work about the life of Rimbaud. Featuring new music by C4 composers, and centered around Steven Gerber’s 20-minute epic Une Saison en Enfer based on Rimbaud’s prose poem of the same name, the work will delve into how Rimbaud’s strange life unfolded as a working-out of his unique vision of himself and his place in the world. The text for the work is taken not only from Rimbaud’s writings, but also quotes from those who knew him.</p><h4>C4: The Choral Composer/Conductor Collective - "Pulse"</h4><p class="msg msg--highlight"><a href="https://www.c4ensemble.org/2024-winter-concert-pulse.html">The Seventh Self</a><br>March 15 and 16, 2024<br>Manhattan</p><p>A concert featuring eclectic choral selections, largely highlighting pulses and disparate rhythms.
